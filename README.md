# metal-sudoku-improved

A small, client-side web implementation of a Sudoku-like game ("Metal Sudoku").
The project is a static web app consisting of `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`.

## What this repo contains

- `index.html` — main HTML file / entry point
- `style.css` — styles for the game UI
- `app.js` — game logic and UI interactions

## Features

- Browser-based Sudoku-style game
- Single-page, no backend required
- Easy to run locally or host as static files

## Prerequisites

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Optional: a small static file server for a proper local dev URL (recommended for some browsers)

## Run locally

Option 1 — Open directly (quickest):

- Double-click `index.html` or open it from your browser via File -> Open.

Option 2 — Serve with a simple HTTP server (recommended):

If you have Python 3 installed, run from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Or, if you prefer Node and have `npm`/`npx`:

```bash
npx http-server -c-1 .  # install-free http server; press Ctrl+C to stop
```

## Development

- Edit `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` as needed.
- Reload the browser to see changes. Use a static server (above) if you run into CORS or file path issues.

## Add this project to a new GitHub repo

From the project root, run these commands to initialize a Git repo, commit, and push to GitHub. Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

```bash
# initialize and make the first commit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit — metal-sudoku-improved"

# create a new remote and push (replace <your-repo-url> with your repo HTTPS or SSH URL)
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) you can also create the repo from the command line:

```bash
gh repo create username/metal-sudoku-improved --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Recommended .gitignore

If you don't already have one, consider ignoring OS and editor files. Example `.gitignore` entries:

```
.DS_Store
node_modules/
*.log
```

## License

This project does not include a license by default. If you want to make it permissive, add a `LICENSE` file. A common choice is the MIT license.

## Contributing

If you'd like help or want to collaborate, open an issue or send a pull request. Keep changes focused and add short notes in your PR explaining the rationale.

## Notes

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add a simple `LICENSE` file (MIT) and a `.gitignore`
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to GitHub Pages
- Improve the README with screenshots or a demo link if you provide an image

Enjoy! If you want any changes to the README (more detail, screenshots, badges, or a specific license), tell me which and I'll update it.
